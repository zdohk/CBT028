           *****      BACKEMUP      *****

FUNCTION OF CLISTS:
   CONVERT A LIST OF DATASET NAMES TO DISK-TO-TAPE BACKUP JCL.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
   ONCE YOU HAVE A SET OF CLISTS LIKE THESE, YOU'LL WONDER
   WHAT YOU EVER DID WITHOUT THEM .

   THIS FAMILY OF CLISTS SOLVES AN OLD, NAGGING PROBLEM OF
   IBM PROGRAMMERS, NAMELY, THAT OF BACKING UP A LARGE
   NUMBER OF PDS'ES AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS TO TAPE.  THE
   USUAL WAYS OF DOING THIS REQUIRES SETTING UP A PROC, AND
   CODING A LARGE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS OF THE PROC, FOR
   DIFFERENT DATASETS. YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE FILE
   NUMBERS ON TAPE, AND IT'S A BIG PAIN IN THE (YOU FILL IN
   THE BLANK), AT ITS EASIEST.

   WITH "BACKEMUP" CLISTS YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE A LIST OF
   THE DATASETS ON A CARD-IMAGE FILE, RUN A CLIST AGAINST
   THE LIST, AND BANG-ZOOM, IN A FEW SECONDS, YOU HAVE YOUR
   IEBCOPY JCL--JUST LIKE THAT !!


SUMMARY OF CLISTS BY CATEGORY:

    BACK UP PDS'ES     - GENUNLDS
    BACK UP SEQUEN     - GENGENR
    BACK UP PDS'ES
      AND SEQUEN       - GENPOPS  (LIST PDS'ES FIRST, THEN A
                                      CARD WITH "?" IN COLUMN
                                      1, THEN LIST ALL
                                      SEQUENTIAL DATASETS)
    BACK UP PDS'ES
      AND SEQUEN ON
      A GIVEN VOLUME   - GENVOL   (INPUT DATASET HAS SAME
                                      RULES AS GENPOPS -
                                      DSORG PO DATASETS
                                      LISTED FIRST, THEN ?
                                      CARD, THEN DSORG PS.
                                      CLIST POINTS TO A
                                      SPECIFIC VOLSER, AND
                                      THE DATASETS DON'T HAVE
                                      TO BE CATALOGED.  )
    JOBCARD FOR JES3   - GNJES3J
    JOBCARD FOR JES2   - GENJOBCD
    JES3 EQUIVALENTS   - GNJES3*  (THESE HAVE JES3 JOBCARDS)

FURTHER HELP AND DESCRIPTION:

   PLEASE SEE MEMBER TSOBATV FOR GREAT ASSISTANCE IN BACKING
   UP PO AND PS DATASETS ON A GIVEN VOLUME.  OUTPUT OF THIS
   JOB IS CLOSE TO THE FORMAT USED FOR INPUT TO THE CLIST
   CALLED "GENVOL".  ONLY MINOR MASSAGING WITH ISPF EDIT
   IS NECESSARY.  "VTOC" PGM FOUND ON CBT TAPE - FILE 300.

   JEFF BROIDO WROTE THE ORIGINAL CLIST, GENUNLD.  I HAVE
   MODIFIED HIS ORIGINAL VERSION FOR SEVERAL OF MY PURPOSES,
   AND HAVE WRITTEN ANOTHER ONE, GENPOPS, THAT ADDED THE
   CAPABILITY OF DUMPING SEQUENTIAL DATASETS AFTER DOING THE
   PDS'ES.  I USE THE SEQCPY PROGRAM FOR SEQUENTIAL DATASET
   DUMPING TO TAPE.  A LOAD LIBRARY CONTAINING THE SEQCPY LOAD
   MODULE IS FOUND IN THE SEQCPY MEMBER OF THIS PDS, AND CAN
   BE RESTORED WITH THE TSO COMMAND:

   TSO RECEIVE INDS(THIS.PDS(SEQCPY))

   MY CLISTS USE THE FILE 299 TAPEMAP PROGRAM (ORIGINAL WAS
   FROM UCLA).  THEY ALSO USE THE INIMITABLE PDS PROGRAM FROM
   FILE 182, AND I USED TO HAVE THE VENDOR PRODUCT PDSFAST,
   WHICH SUBSTITUTES FOR IEBCOPY WITH THE SAME JCL, EXCEPT FOR
   PROGRAM NAME.  THESE CLISTS MAY NEED TSO/E, BUT IF YOU'RE
   CLEVER, YOU CAN GET AROUND THAT (IT'S ONLY NEEDED DURING
   THE INPUT FILE READ, IN WHICH THE DATASET NAMES ARE
   CONVERTED INTO A HUGE STRING).
