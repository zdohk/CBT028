           *****      BACKEMUP   ADDENDA      ********
05/10/88

PLEASE SEE SAMPLE CLIST INPUT IN THE SAMPINPT MEMBER OF THIS PDS.


PLEASE NOTE THAT THE "BACKEMUP" CLISTS ARE USEFUL FOR DOING IEBCOPY
AND SEQUENTIAL BACKUPS OF NONVSAM DATASETS ON OLD DISK PACKS WHEN
CONVERTING DEVICE TYPES, SAY FROM 3330V OR 3350 TO 3380.  IT IS EASY
TO GENERATE THE INPUT STREAM FOR THE "GENVOL" OR "GENVOLI" OR
"GENVOLIF" CLISTS FROM THE TSO-IN-BATCH JOB TSOBATV1, WHICH IS
INCLUDED IN THIS PDS.  TSOBATV1 TAKES A VTOC LIST OF ALL THE
DATASETS ON THE PACK AND PUTS THE DATASET LIST IN A FORM THAT IS
VERY CLOSE TO WHAT THESE CLISTS NEED FOR INPUT.


IF YOU ARE BACKING UP ALL THE PARTITIONED AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS ON
ONE PACK, YOU CAN RUN THE GENVOLIF CLIST AGAINST THE ENTIRE LIST OF
DESIRED DATASETS ON THE PACK.  WHEN THE TAPE REEL OVERFLOWS, JUST
CANCEL THE JOB WITHOUT A PURGE, AND MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF WHICH
DATASETS GOT BACKED UP PROPERLY.  LOP THOSE DATASET NAMES OFF THE
TOP OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET LIST, RERUN THE CLIST GENVOLIF TO
GENERATE NEW JCL FOR A NEW TAPE REEL, AND CONTINUE BACKING UP THE
REST OF THE DATASETS ON THE NEXT REEL.  WHEN ALL THE DATASETS ARE
BACKED UP, JUST RUN A TAPEMAP JOB AGAINST THE REELS THAT GOT FILLED
UP COMPLETELY.  THIS IS PAINLESS, RELATIVE TO CODING JCL TO BACK UP
HUNDREDS OF SEPARATE DATASETS.  MEMBER CALLED "TAPEMAP" IN THIS PDS
HAS SAMPLE JCL TO RUN THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM (FILE 299) FOR MULTIPLE
TAPE VOLUMES.

THE SEQUENTIAL COPY PROGRAM "SEQCPY" IS FOUND IN LOAD MODULE
FORM IN MEMBER SEQCPY, AND CAN BE RESTORED BY THE TSO COMMAND:
  TSO RECEIVE INDS(THIS.PDS(SEQCPY))
SEQCPY HAS NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE FORMAT OF THE SUFFIXES TO
//IN--- AND //OUT---.  THEY MUST ONLY BE PAIRED.

I HAVE REWRITTEN THE CLIST "GENPOPS" FOR THE FTL PROGRAM, CALLING
IT "GENPOPSF".  "GENPOPS" BACKS UP LISTS OF CATALOGED PO AND PS
DATASETS.  I HAVE ALSO REWRITTEN "GENVOL" AS "GENVOLF".  "GENVOL"
BACKS UP PO AND PS DATASETS ON A SINGLE PACK, CATALOGED OR NOT
CATALOGED.  "GENVOLI", WHICH IS LIKE "GENVOL", BUT WHICH INITTS THE
OUTPUT TAPE FIRST, HAS BEEN REWRITTEN AS "GENVOLIF".  THIS WILL GIVE
YOU AN IDEA AS TO HOW TO CONVERT ANY OTHER OF THE CLISTS IF YOU NEED
TO.  THIS PACKAGE OF CLISTS SHOULD NOW BE USEFUL TO A WIDER
AUDIENCE, SINCE ALL THE NECESSARY MATERIALS ARE CONTAINED IN ONE
SOURCE, NAMELY, ON THE CBT TAPE.
