             CHANGES TO THE BACKEMUP CLIST COLLECTION

1.  CLISTs GENUNLD and GENPOPS were reworked for a JES2 environment
    at z/OS 1.4 and 1.5.

2.  A sequential copy program called SEQCPY is available for use
    with this package, as a TSO XMIT-format loadlib in member SEQCPY
    of this pds.  The job in member SEQCPY@ will convert the SEQCPY
    member into a usable load library.

3.  The GENUNLDX CLIST was adapted from GENUNLD and should produce
    similar output JCL.  The difference is that if you have to back
    up several hundred datasets with GENUNLD, you may run out of
    TSO region.  With GENUNLDX, you won't.  The difference is that
    with GENUNLDX, the list of dataset names is read twice, whereas
    with the other CLISTs, it is stored and rewritten several times.
